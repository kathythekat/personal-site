    <p>
      I am a SF native who recently discovered a newfound love for coding. I'm
      especially drawn to building beautiful, minimalistic, and UI-focused
      frontend things. Before this path, I was a critical care nurse for 6
      years. Outside of coding, I am passionate about mountain/gravel biking,
      exploring the outdoors, and spending time with my 2 dogs, Remy and
      Oatmeal.
